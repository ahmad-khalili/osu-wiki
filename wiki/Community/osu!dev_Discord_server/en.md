# osu!dev Discord server

**osu!dev** is the official [Discord](https://discordapp.com) server for working on osu!'s open source and community projects. This is the main place to contribute to osu!'s development and get in touch with the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team).

The permanent invite link is <https://discord.gg/ppy>.

People new to the server may feel free to introduce themselves in the `#introductions` channel, but doing so is not a requirement to interact with the rest of the server.
