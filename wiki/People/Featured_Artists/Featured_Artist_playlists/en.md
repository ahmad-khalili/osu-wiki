# Featured Artist playlists

Each month, new **Featured Artist playlists** are published in [osu!(lazer)](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) highlighting [Featured Artist](/wiki/People/Featured_Artists) content across all [game modes](/wiki/Game_mode). The playlists avoid a strict format, so playlist parameters, beatmap selections, and prize criteria vary each month.

Access the playlists via the **play** menu on osu!(lazer) and filtering by **Featured Artists** in the top right corner.
