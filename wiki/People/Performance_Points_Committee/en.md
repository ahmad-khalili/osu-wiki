# Performance Points Committee

The **Performance Points Committee** is a panel of well-versed players and developers who facilitate and approve updates to the [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) and [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Star_rating) algorithms. Their goal is to help [osu! developers](/wiki/People/Developers) push changes faster and with more community coordination.

The osu! panel was first announced to the public through the [November 2021 *Performance Points & Star Rating Updates* news post](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-11-09-performance-points-star-rating-updates) in response to a [community survey](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2021-08-17-pp-sr-survey) held earlier that year.

The osu!mania panel was formed 22 April 2022 in response to [another community survey regarding performance points and star rating in osu!taiko and osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2022-01-14-taiko-mania-pp-sr-survey) held earlier that year, as well as in anticipation of a surge in active development effort, starting with [a change in difficulty calculation for hold note releases in osu!mania](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/17913).

The osu!taiko panel was formed on 1 May 2022 in response to the same survey as above, with [major changes to the star rating algorithm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z5GC4DMqOVzeIERMSK3qpQaqjq-sVnhbuoxAwy9qxDs/edit).
