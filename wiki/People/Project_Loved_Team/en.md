# Project Loved Team

The **Project Loved Team** are members of the osu! community who manage [Project Loved](/wiki/Community/Project_Loved), the voting platform that promotes [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) to the [Loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) category. They are distinguished by their usergroup badge that reads `LVD` and the username colour that is candy pink on the forums.

The Project Loved Team mostly consists of *captains* for each [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode). Captains are responsible for nominating beatmaps to the Loved category and act as representatives for the community in having a good sense of which maps to choose. They also write short descriptions about the nominated maps to help readers get a feel for each map in case they have not seen or played them before, which can be seen in Project Loved news posts.

The [Project Loved group page](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/31) lists all of the team members. A more detailed member listing for all of the various roles within the Project Loved team, as well as previous members, can be found on the [Project Loved website](https://loved.sh/team).

## Trivia

- ::{ flag=US }:: [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689) created the original team of captains in September 2017 along with the [Captain's Pick](/wiki/History_of_osu!/History_of_Loved#captain's-pick-and-project-loved-(sep-2017-â€“-present)) system that was later renamed to Project Loved. Until late 2019, he oversaw and managed the whole project.
- Prior to the 28th of April, 2021, the [Project Loved group page](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/31) was not public and used only for administrative purposes. As of now, it is publicly available.
  - Until the 16th of April, 2021, the only people that had been in the group were ::{ flag=US }:: [clayton](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3666350), ::{ flag=LT }:: [huu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6044237), ::{ flag=SG }:: [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707), and ::{ flag=US }:: [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689). Now, all of the Project Loved Team belongs to the group.
