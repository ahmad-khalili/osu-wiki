# Snapping

**Snapping** refers to a [hit object](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object)'s position on the [hit objects timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines#hit-objects) in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor). Changing the [beat snap divisor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Beat_Snap_Divisor) allows hit objects to "snap" to different ticks when moved in the timeline.
