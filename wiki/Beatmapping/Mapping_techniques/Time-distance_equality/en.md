# Time-distance equality

**Time-distance equality** is an [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [mapping technique](/wiki/Beatmapping/Mapping_techniques) where spacing between [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) on the playfield is proportional to the time between them. This is automatically calculated by the [distance snap](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Distance_snap) feature of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor).

In lower [difficulties](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty), time-distance equality is used to make gameplay more intuitive for new players.
